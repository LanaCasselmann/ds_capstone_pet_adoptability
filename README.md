# Data Science Capstone Project: Predicting Adoption Speed for Shelter Pets
Capstone project for the Data Practitioner Bootcamp at neufische - school and pool for digital talent

## The Team
We are a team of, Data Practitioner, trainees at Neuefische Institute. We are:

- [Anna](https://github.com/Cazta) 
- [Qurratulain](https://github.com/qurratulainee)
- [Lana](https://github.com/LanaCasselmann)
- [Jan](https://github.com/jan-schlautmann)

## Project Description:
Animal shelters around the world are full and underfunded - how can they best use their limited resources? We built a Machine learning model predicting how fast sheltered cats and dogs are adopted, using data from Petfinder.my (via Kaggle). We incorporated the model into a Streamlit Web App for shelters, enabling them to predict the adoption speed and plan ahead.

After a hypothesis-driven EDA, cleaning the data and feature engineering (including basic nlp) we trained several models, chose the best one based on our classification metric, performed a thorough error-analysis and build a Streamlit Web Application for the trained model so shelters can predict the adoption speed of animals based on their features.

- Data: [Petfinder.my Adoption Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data)
- Target: (Adoption Speed) in 4 categories (multi-classification problem)
- Model Metric: Quadratic Weighted Cohen's Kappa
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forests Classifier, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Streamlit Web Application, Object Serialization, NLP, MLFlow
